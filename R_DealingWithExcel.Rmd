 1. Review a list of R packages that interact with Excel
 
 2. Focus on strategies for working with spreadsheets that are optimized for 
    human readability instead of machine readability.

## R packages that interact with Excel

The R-Data Import/Export Manual has a "[chapter](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-data.html#Reading-Excel-spreadsheets)" 
about interacting with Excel. 

>"The first piece of advice is to avoid doing so if possible!"

Instead, they suggest opening the spreadsheet, saving as a .csv or similar, 
and then reading in the .csv file.  

Undeterred, I searched CRAN for excel and these are the packages that popped up:

```{r pkg-list, echo=FALSE}
data_frame(
  `Package Name` = c("[`excel.link`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/excel.link/)",
                     "[`readxl`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/)",
                     "[`xlsx`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xlsx/)",
                     "[`XLConnect`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XLConnect/)",

## Import from Excel: Machine Friendly Files 

Machine friendly files with variables in columns and observations in rows. 
Ideally, they have variable names in the top row. 

*e.g. [2016-17 District Accountability Report Cards](https://apps2.dpi.wi.gov/reportcards/)*

```{r}
#Download the file
tdir <- tempdir()
fname <- file.path(tdir, "ReportCard_Dist_1617.xlsx")
curl::curl_download(url = "http://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/accountability/xls/2016-17_district_reportcard_data.xlsx", 
              destfile = fname)
```

![Quick look at 2016-17_district_reportcard_data.xlsx](images/distRpt17_view.PNG)

## Basic Import: `readxl`

```{r}
#Using readxl
library(readxl)

#Check Sheet Names
excel_sheets(fname)

#Import Data
read_excel(path = fname, sheet = "Data") %>% head(10)
```

## Basic Import: `openxlsx`

```{r}
#Using openxlsx
library(openxlsx)

#Check Sheet Names
getSheetNames(fname)

#Import Data
read.xlsx(xlsxFile = fname, sheet = "Data") %>% head(10)
```

## `readxl` vs `openxlsx`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tribble(
  ~char,                                   ~readxl,        ~openxlsx,         ~notes,

## Import from Excel: Human Friendly Files

Couldn't find a good example on our public download page ( 
`r paste(emo::ji("nerd_face"), emo::ji("thumbs_up"), emo::ji("fireworks"))`). 

I know I have some that aren't on the website, though. There is nothing wrong 
with this, but just hard to work with.

Instead, I will use the nicely formated [YRBS 2017 summary tables](https://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/sspw/pdf/yrbs17summarytables.pdf) 
and pretend they exist in an Excel document.

![Quick look at 2017 YRBS: QN9](images/yrbs17_view.PNG)

## Enter: `tidyxl`

What I want:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data_frame(
  subgrp1 = c("Total", "Total", "Total", "Total", "Total"),
  subgrp2 = c("Total", "15 or younger", "16-17", "18 or Older", "9th Grade"),
  denominator = c(2048, 709, 1062, 276, 480),
  pct = c(17.4, 18.7, 16.1, 18.6, 19.5),
  ci95 = c("(15.3-19.7)", "(15.8-21.9)", "(13.2-19.25)", "(12.3-27.1)", "(15.4-24.3)")
) %>% 
  knitr::kable(.) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = FALSE)
```

## Step 1: Import cells `xlsx_cells()`

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyxl)
yrbs17 <- xlsx_cells("yrbs17_QN9.xlsx", 
                     sheets = "QN9",
                     check_filetype = TRUE,
                     include_blank_cells = FALSE)
yrbs17

#The cell values are in the 'character' column
yrbs17$character[1:10]

#Cell formatting info is a tibble in the 'character_formatted' column
yrbs17$character_formatted[[1]]
```

## Step 2: Find patterns 

- `subgrp1` is in row 3
- `subgrp2` is in columns (A) B
- `denominator` is in columns E, I, M
- `pct` is in columns C, G, K
- `ci95` is in columns D, H, L

and

- variable names are in row 4

```{r extract-subgrp1}
#extract subgrp1
yrbs17 %>% 
  filter(row == 3) %>% 
  select(address, row, col, character) %>% 
  knitr::kable(.) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = FALSE)
```

```{r extract-subgrp2}
#extract subgrp2
yrbs17 %>% 
  filter(col == 2, row > 1) %>% 
  select(address, row, col, character) %>% 
  knitr::kable(.) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = FALSE)
```

```{r extract-denominator}
#extract denominator (pct and ci95 are similar, just shifted one over)
yrbs17 %>% 
  filter(col %in% c(5, 9, 13), !is.na(numeric)) %>% #only keep numeric values
  arrange(col, row) %>%                             #sort rows within columns
  select(address, row, col, numeric) %>% 
  knitr::kable(.) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = FALSE)

```

## Step 3: Create a useable data.frame

Now that we have the basics down, we can assemble a data.frame and be sure
that everything worked correctly.

```{r assemble-data-frame}
#Assemble the pieces
subgrp1 <- yrbs17 %>% 
  filter(row == 3) %>% 
  select(col, subgrp1 = character)

#Merged cells are tricky currently
subgrp1 <- bind_rows(
  subgrp1,
  mutate(subgrp1, col = col + 1),
  mutate(subgrp1, col = col + 2)
)
  
subgrp2 <- yrbs17 %>% 
  filter(col == 2, row > 1) %>% 
  select(row, subgrp2 = character)

metric_names <- yrbs17 %>% 
  filter(row == 4) %>% 
  mutate(
    metric_name = case_when(
      character == "Percentage" ~ "pct",
      character == "95% confidence interval" ~ "ci95",
      character == "N" ~ "denominator"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(col, metric_name)

#In this I have to take that numeric and string contents end up in one column
metrics <- yrbs17 %>% 
  filter(col %in% 3:13, row > 4, row != 16) %>%   
  select(address, row, col, numeric, character) %>% 
  mutate(
    value = if_else(is.na(numeric), character, as.character(numeric))
  ) %>% 
  select(-numeric, -character)

#Start merging to create a single usable data.frame
out <- metrics %>% 
  left_join(metric_names) %>% 
  left_join(subgrp1) %>% 
  left_join(subgrp2) %>% 
  select(subgrp1, subgrp2, metric_name, value) %>%
  spread(metric_name, value)

out %>% 
  select(subgrp1, subgrp2, denominator, pct, ci95) %>% 
  arrange(desc(subgrp1), subgrp2) %>% 
  knitr::kable(.) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = FALSE)
  
```

## Is it worth it?

You may be thinking:

>Gosh, is all that complexity worth it? I could have just cut and 
paste in Excel to get the data to behave well in `R`?

That is a valid question, and one I had before diving in to this package. The
answer is that if it is a one-off project it probably isn't worth it.

**Two reasons why (and under what circumstances) you should consider it:**

1. You will have to import this kind of table a lot ... either at one time or 
   regularly in the future. In this case, I would incorporate the data 
   processing steps into a function.
2. You want to be sure to avoid copy/paste errors. Merging by row and/or column
   location ensures you don't accidentally shift things, copy over existing 
   rows, etc. This allows for more reproducible results because you don't 
   alter the original (source) data.

## Bonus: Checking for spreadsheet smells   

<style>
.footer {
    color: black; 
    background: #E8E8E8;
    top: 76%;
    text-align:left; 
    width:100%;
    fontsize: x-small;
}
</style>

Ever worry that the spreadsheet someone sent you was not as trustworthy as 
you would like? It was likely a smelly spreadsheet.* Smelly spreadsheets 
don't necessarily indicate errors ... their complexity just makes it harder
to maintain and more likely to introduce errors.**

Common spreadsheet smells refer to complicated formulas in cells and include: 

- Multiple Operations
- **Multiple References**
- **Conditional Complexity**
- Long Calculation Chain
- **Duplicated Formulas**

`tidyxl::xlex()` is a function that offers ways to identify potential
spreadsheet smells in these spreadsheets.

<div class = "footer">

*The term comes from code smells (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell)
and was ported to the spreadsheet realm by Felienne Hermans et al 
([this paper](http://swerl.tudelft.nl/twiki/pub/FelienneHermans/Publications/paper_camera_ready.pdf),
[this paper](http://swerl.tudelft.nl/twiki/pub/FelienneHermans/Publications/TUD-SERG-2011-030.pdf),
[or this paper](http://www.fast-standard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jansen-B.-and-Hermans-F.-2015.-Code-Smells-in-Spreadsheet-Formulas-Revisited-on-an-Industrial-Dataset.pdf.))

**There is even at least one set of standards for constructing non-smelly 
spreadsheets <http://www.fast-standard.org/>.

## Exporting Data

<div class="tumblr-post" data-href="https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/R_5eR06UqopXPglMaNErlA/156949714637" data-did="55e6e6d722c823fcd2d41bba7a54be00fc226304"><a href="https://redpenblackpen.tumblr.com/post/156949714637/why-do-i-use-so-much-excel">https://redpenblackpen.tumblr.com/post/156949714637/why-do-i-use-so-much-excel</a></div>  <script async src="https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js"></script>
</div>

## Super Basic Export: .csv

The easiest way to export data from R that is accessible in excel is in
comma separated values (.csv) format with 

- `write.csv()` or
- `readr::write_csv()` if you're a fan of the tidyverse

in my opinion, the latter has nicer defaults (not printing rownames/numbers).

## Basic Export 1: `openxlsx`

**Single Data Frame**

```{r export-single}
#Using the iris data
write.xlsx(iris, file = file.path(tdir, "iris.xlsx"))

dir(tdir, pattern = "*.xlsx")
```

![](images/iris_view.png)

## Basic Export 2: `openxlsx`

**Multiple Data Frames**

If you need to write multiple data.frames to a single excel file, you just
supply a list of data.frames. If the list is named, the worksheet names will
equal the list names.

```{r export-multiple}
#Lets create an Excel file with all the ggplot2 datasets.
gg2dfs <- data(package = "ggplot2")$results
gg2dfs[,3:4]

#Quick and dirty way to turn the above into a named list of data.frames
out <- lapply(1:nrow(gg2dfs), function(x) eval(as.symbol(gg2dfs[x, "Item"])))
names(out) <- sapply(1:nrow(gg2dfs), function(x) gg2dfs[x, "Item"])

write.xlsx(out, file.path(tdir, "ggplot2_datasets.xlsx"))

dir(tdir, pattern = ".xlsx")

```

![](images/ggplot2_view.png)

## Advanced Export

Theoretically you could move from a tidy data.frame to a human friendly 
spreadheet using the `XLConnect` and/or `xlsx` packages.

This may be helpful if you are designing canned reports that rely on some R
interaction.

I am too lazy to learn the details, so here are links to the relevant 
documentation

- `xlsx`: see `?createWorkbook` and all the referenced help files
- `XLconnect`: see <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XLConnect/vignettes/XLConnect.pdf> 
   for a 19 page manual.
